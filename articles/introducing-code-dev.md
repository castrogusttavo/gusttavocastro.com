## Why are we doing this?

Back when I was CEO at Softis, I faced a frustrating problem: I wanted to build large-scale applications but kept hitting roadblocks.

We had amazing ideas, but they never left the whiteboard due to a lack of knowledge in key areas—especially system architecture.

Then, with the rise of AI tools like ChatGPT, I realized something: the way we learn to build applications has fundamentally changed. Access to knowledge is easier, but structuring it effectively? That’s still a pain point.

After analyzing all the possible solutions, I became obsessed with fixing this problem once and for all.

I started sharing posts on LinkedIn to help developers create real-world solutions that merge code and innovation.

The deeper I dug, the clearer it became—this was just the tip of the iceberg.

Learning to program efficiently is still a huge challenge, so we decided to explore something new.

## What problem are we solving?

We're building a learning platform, and we’re starting with Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA).

The idea? Learn through hands-on challenges and exercises, without the distractions of shipping features to production.

Think of it as a next-generation LeetCode—built for the way developers actually learn today.

## Why now?

If you look at the biggest competitors, you’ll notice they were all founded between 2012 and 2017—and most have already been acquired.

That means they now prioritize enterprise customers and optimize for sales-driven growth.

Nobody is focusing on creating an exceptional developer experience. Nobody is pushing real innovation.

There isn’t a single DSA platform truly built for modern developers. We’re here to change that.

We need to stop writing code like it’s 2010 and rethink how algorithms are designed and applied in 2025 and beyond.

Algorithm development needs a reboot. A refresh. A modern approach that aligns with how we build applications today.

## Join us

I’m beyond excited to take on the role of Developer Experience Engineer and build a platform that developers will genuinely love.

We’re creating something special here, and I can’t wait to share it with you.
