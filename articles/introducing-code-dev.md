## Why are we doing this?

A few years ago, when I was CEO at Softis, I faced a recurring frustration—building scalable applications felt out of reach.

We had incredible ideas, but they never left the drawing board due to gaps in knowledge, architecture, and execution.

Fast forward to today. With tools like ChatGPT, learning how to build applications has become more accessible than ever. The landscape has shifted, and now, the only thing standing between developers and production-ready code is the right learning experience.

After diving deep into the existing solutions, I became obsessed with solving this problem once and for all.

I started publishing content on LinkedIn, sharing practical ways for developers to bridge the gap between coding and innovation.

But the more I explored, the more I realized—we’re only scratching the surface.

The real challenge? Learning how to think like a developer. So we decided to build something new.

## What problem are we solving?

We’re building a platform that redefines learning—starting with Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA).

The idea is simple: learn by doing. Solve challenges, tackle real-world problems, and level up your skills without worrying about breaking production.

Think of it as LeetCode, but reimagined for the next generation of developers.

## Why now?

Look at the major platforms in this space. Most were founded between 2012 and 2017. They’ve been acquired. They’ve shifted focus.

They prioritize enterprise customers. Growth is driven by sales, not innovation.

And here’s the real problem—no one is building a truly exceptional developer experience.

The tools we use to learn DSA feel outdated. Stuck in 2010. We need to rethink how algorithms are taught in 2025 and beyond.

Developers deserve a better way to practice coding. A modern, engaging, and intuitive platform built for how we learn today.

## Join us

I’m beyond excited to step into this challenge and build something that developers will love.

We’re creating something special here. And I can’t wait to share it with you.
