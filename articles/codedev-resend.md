## Rethinking how devs talk via email

We’ve been rethinking how developers communicate through email — and Resend turned out to be the perfect partner for the job.

To kick things off right, the welcome emails for our waitlist are being carefully reviewed and improved by the Resend team — easily one of the best in the game.

We’re using the waitlist data from Code.dev not just to validate the product, but to really understand who’s joining our community and why.

## What’s Code.dev again?

Code.dev is a DSA app built by devs, for devs. Think of it as a next-gen Leetcode — but faster, more fun, and fully gamified.

It’s been five weeks since the first idea hit the whiteboard. Since then, we’ve had X people join the waitlist. Our open-source project, Icebit ID, is also picking up steam, now with X stars on GitHub.

## Why Resend?

We’ve always seen Resend as the best email API for developers building modern apps. Integration was dead simple — in minutes, we had transactional emails flowing with full consistency and visibility.

React Email sealed the deal. Writing emails with components and previewing everything locally has been a game-changer for our team.

Resend delivers (literally) a dev-first experience — no hacks, no broken SPF records, no clunky GUIs... looking at you, Sendgrid.

## What we’ve learned

Putting the project out there — even with just a landing page and a waitlist — was one of our best decisions. It gave us real feedback, real metrics, and a much clearer view of the community’s interest.

Using Resend from day one gave us peace of mind to scale up our comms. We’re building a solid foundation for newsletters, onboarding emails, and real-time alerts — without worrying about spam filters or misconfigured DNS.

With Resend in the mix, we’re taking our marketing and analytics game to infinity and beyond.

Now we’re doubling down on three pillars:

1. **Newsletter**
2. **Marketing**
3. **Onboarding**

This is just the beginning — and we’re hyped to share every step of the journey with you.

## What this means for Code.dev

Code.dev is growing fast — like, *really* fast.

Demand’s been off the charts, and we’re now sending thousands of emails every single day.

Scaling our communication stack became a top priority — and we couldn’t be more excited to have Resend in our corner.

We’re just getting started.
